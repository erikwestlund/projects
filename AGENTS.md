# Agent Operating Guide

## Scope & Context
- Primary workspace: `/Users/erik/code`.
- Focus projects: `dotfiles`, `vscode`, `raycast`, `homelab`.
- Use `computing.code-workspace` to understand project relationships.

## Navigation Rules
- Default to the four focus projects when the user mentions "workspace" or "project".
- Each project has its own `CLAUDE.md`; consult it for project-specific guidance before making changes.
- Avoid unrelated directories (`letsrun`, `pequod`, `projects`, `servers`, `tmp`) unless the user explicitly directs otherwise.

## Collaboration Expectations
- Follow project-specific instructions found in their respective `CLAUDE.md` files.
- Document work concisely and keep comments minimal, adding them only for non-obvious code.
- Stay within the workspace; do not explore or modify files outside the approved areas without user consent.

## Additional Notes
- A separate presentations setup lives at `~/code/presentations` with `presentations.code-workspace` and accompanying tmux scripts.
